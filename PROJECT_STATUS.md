## 🚀 You're Ready to Deploy!

Everything is in place. Here's what you need to do next:

### Step 1: Download This Folder
Download the entire \`accountability-project\` folder to your computer.

### Step 2: Follow the Deployment Guide
Open **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** and follow the steps:

1. **Install software** (Git, Node.js, Python)
2. **Upload to GitHub** 
3. **Deploy to Cloudflare Pages**
4. **Run the image fetcher** to get Wikipedia profile photos

## 📸 About Profile Images

Your App.jsx file already has Wikipedia image URLs hardcoded for many profiles:
- Donald Trump ✅
- Bill Clinton ✅
- Bill Gates ✅
- Elon Musk ✅
- Howard Lutnick ✅
- Prince Andrew ✅
- And many more...

Some profiles don't have URLs yet (showing as empty strings ""):
- John Phelan
- Steven Tisch
- Leslie Wexner
- Leon Black
- Jes Staley

**The image fetcher script will download higher-quality versions** of all available images from Wikipedia and save them locally. This gives you:
1. Faster loading (local files)
2. No broken links if Wikipedia changes URLs
3. Consistent image sizing

## 🎯 Timeline Estimate

- **Software installation**: 15-30 minutes
- **GitHub upload**: 10-15 minutes
- **Cloudflare deployment**: 5 minutes (mostly waiting)
- **Image fetching**: 2-3 minutes
- **Testing**: 10-15 minutes

**Total**: About 1 hour for complete deployment

## ⚠️ Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**
A: No! The deployment guide is written for complete beginners. Everything is copy-paste.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**
A: Come back to the chat and share the error message. I'll help you fix it.

**Q: Can I make changes later?**
A: Yes! Just edit the files, push to GitHub, and Cloudflare automatically rebuilds.

**Q: What does this cost?**
A: $0 for hosting. Only cost is domain name (~$10/year) if you want a custom URL.
